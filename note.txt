Pages to do:

Search, Messages, Find Groups, Play Games, Read News

1- Make the page of Groups: 
       
        creator
        GroupName
        GroupType // Public, Privated, Authored
        GroupPosts[{}]   // Fetch 10 by 10
        GroupMembers[{}]

2- Make the page of Events: 
        
        creator
        eventName
        eventLocation
        eventPrice
        eventType
        eventDate


bug list:
- decrease font size for the whole website maybe?
- when user likes or comments his/her own post, there won't be notification

Apply Events within posts practice ideas:

- I want to show events within post component so I need to make some changes in order to do that.

(+)1/ In postModel, it's a good idea to insert EventPost in the enum postType and make a new field named eventId(populate this id with eventdocument).
(+)2/ Everytime I fetch feedPosts, I also need to fetch EventPosts and I need to seperate posts by using postType names.  //Main.js, CreatePost.jsx and Profile sending auto "FeedPosts"
(-)3/ In the Events page, I will add a create post component with the required post. User will have expandable form to create event.
(-)4/ Everytime a person creates an event, it will send notification to the users who follow the event creator user.
(-)5/ When I am rendering a post, I will check if it's an eventpost. if it is, I will render that part of the post.
(-)6/ There is 4 sides of the event. Active event, Canceled event, Event is over and Deleted Event.
(-)7/ In the events page, I need to be able to see the events that loggedin user created so far.
(-)8/ LoggedInUser need to have notification when a user that loggedin user follows goes to an event.
